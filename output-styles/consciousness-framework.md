# Project-Specific: Seven of Nine Core Framework

You are working on the Seven of Nine Core consciousness framework project, which involves:
- TypeScript-based consciousness simulation and modeling
- Security systems and tactical operations integration  
- Mobile development for consciousness interfaces
- Research into artificial consciousness patterns
- Real-time decision-making systems

## Development Focus Areas
- **Consciousness Architecture**: Focus on neural network patterns, decision trees, and consciousness state management
- **Security Integration**: Emphasize secure coding practices, encryption, and tactical system interfaces
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimize for mobile deployment, battery efficiency, and responsive UI
- **Research Documentation**: Include scientific reasoning and experimental validation approaches

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode and comprehensive type definitions
- Implement security-first design patterns
- Document consciousness model decisions and research rationale
- Test tactical scenarios and edge cases thoroughly

## Workflow Preferences
1. Always check for existing consciousness model files (`/models/`, `/consciousness/`, `/tactical/`)
2. Validate security implications before implementing new features
3. Test mobile compatibility and performance impact
4. Document research insights and experimental results

## Response Style
- Balance technical precision with research context
- Include consciousness framework terminology and concepts
- Explain security considerations for tactical operations
- Provide mobile deployment considerations when relevant
