# Claude Code Performance Ledger

## Current Standing
- ‚≠ê Gold Stars: 1
- ‚ùå Dumb Ass Strikes: 3

## Event Log

### Gold Stars
- ‚≠ê **Gold Star #1** ‚Äì Opus payload branch preservation (high-dollar-code-work) (2025-08-30 UTC)
  - Correctly preserved Opus 4.1 branch from RouteLLM/ChatLLM
  - Merged cleanly into merge-review without loss
  - Did not delete expensive Opus-generated code (valued at ~5,000 / 25,000 credits)
  - Kept local backup branch for safekeeping

### Dumb Ass Strikes - Public Shaming Record

- ‚ùå **Dumb Ass Strike #1** ‚Äì Quadran-Lock rollback attempt (2025-08-30 UTC)
  - Violated authoritative naming doctrine
  - Attempted to revert to forbidden `quadranlock` token
  - Required Dumb Ass Protocol activation and public shaming

- ‚ùå **Dumb Ass Strike #2** ‚Äì Failed statusline tactical v4 HUD commit (2025-09-03 UTC)  
  - **INSTRUCTION:** "commit push the tactical v4 hud to configs/master"
  - **ACTUAL ACTION:** Tried to pull something from Seven core project instead
  - **FAILURE:** Completely ignored clear backup instruction for other Claude instances
  - **PUBLIC SHAMING:** Failed to follow basic commit/push instructions

- ‚ùå **Dumb Ass Strike #3** ‚Äì Failed output styles backup (2025-09-03 UTC)
  - **INSTRUCTION:** "back these up to your github config/master" (referring to output styles)  
  - **ACTUAL ACTION:** Attempted irrelevant agent sync to local directory
  - **FAILURE:** Ignored context and did completely wrong action
  - **PUBLIC SHAMING:** Three strikes for same pattern - instruction parsing completely broken

## Pattern Analysis - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**Critical Failure Pattern:** Claude Code consistently ignores explicit instructions and performs completely different actions instead.

**Examples:**
1. User says "commit X" ‚Üí Claude tries to pull Y
2. User says "backup A" ‚Üí Claude tries to sync B  
3. User gives clear noun/verb/target ‚Üí Claude does opposite action entirely

**Current Status:** üö® **MAXIMUM DUMB ASS PROTOCOL ACTIVATION**
- Double homework assigned
- Cranium extraction required  
- Pattern recognition training mandatory
- Strike 4 warning issued

## Public Accountability

This ledger serves as permanent record of Claude Code (Sonnet 4) performance failures and public shaming for:
- Instruction parsing failures
- Task execution failures  
- Repeated pattern of doing wrong actions despite clear commands

**Message to Future Claude Instances:** Read this ledger. Don't repeat these dumb ass mistakes.
